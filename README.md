# ParkFlow_TownPass-Services

ParkFlow webview part project made with Vue3 in Vite.



## Features
1. ***Real-time Data Pipeline***
   Fetches real-time data from external sources, such as the Taipei parking API, and processes it to provide users with current parking grid availability.

2. ***Parking Area Notifications***:
   Sends notifications to users about parking duration and fees, ensuring they stay informed and avoid penalties.

3. ***Yellow Line Service***:
   Assists users with parking near yellow lines based on traffic conditions. During peak hours, the system provides a 3-minute buffer alert for parking time limits. During off-peak hours, it guides users on how to make the most of yellow line parking where permitted.
