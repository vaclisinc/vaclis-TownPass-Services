# ParkFlow - TownPass Services

ParkFlow is a web-based application built with Vue3 and Vite, designed to make parking in Taipei more efficient and user-friendly by providing real-time parking information and assistance.

This project was developed during a 24-hour non-stop Taipei Hackathon, where we were selected as one of the top 12 teams out of 55 entries. We proudly secured third place, winning a prize of NT$100,000.

## Features
1. ***Real-time Data Pipeline***
   Integrates with external sources such as the Taipei parking API to deliver up-to-date parking availability for different parking grids in Taipei.

2. ***Parking Area Notifications***:
   Notifies users about parking duration and fees to help avoid penalties, ensuring they remain informed throughout their parking period.

3. ***Yellow Line Service***:
   Assists users with parking near yellow lines, adapting to traffic conditions. Provides a 3-minute buffer alert during peak hours and offers guidance on maximizing yellow line parking during off-peak hours where permitted.
